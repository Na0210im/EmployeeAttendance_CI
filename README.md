# About Employee Attendance System PHP Project
Moving on, this Employee Attendance System project in PHP CodeIgniter focuses mainly on keeping track of 
employees. Also, the system displays all the categories with their respective details of each. In addition,
the system allows checking it and out too by the employees. The project is divided into two categories: Admin and Employee Panel. 
In an overview of this web application, an employee’s account has its own limitations within the system. 
The employee can only contribute to maintaining his/her attendance. For this, the user has to fill up certain forms before checking in.
The forms contain images, notes, and work locations. When it comes to adding images, the system refers to add current photos of employees in a working state.
Also, the employee can check out any time.

# Weekend and Employee Shifts
This whole system strictly follows the weekend days rules as well as shift timings. So, the users should make sure of the timings as well as the day. Meaning, the system does not allow any users to check in on the weekend. And the employee user can only check in once a day. The system won’t allow numerous attendance on a single day. Additionally, each employee has their own shift timings. So, the employee has to check in the system at the right timings. Else, the system marks the attendance as late. Besides, an employee can only check their own personal profiles.

# Admin Panel
Talking about the admin panel, an admin has all the access to the system. All the management sides fall upon the administrator. An admin has the right to manage departments, shifts, locations, and employees. In order to add up a new department and location record, the user has to provide their respective names accordingly. Similarly, the user has to provide details such as shift starting and ending times. After the management of these sections, the admin has to add employee records too. Employee records consist of details such as name, address, photo, shift timings, department, dob, and joining date.

# Employee Account and Attendance Reports
Creating a user account does not set up access for the employees to sign into the system. It requires some additional changes too. After creating a user, the admin has to set up his/her employee account by setting up a new password. The usernames are based upon their departments. On the other hand, an admin can view attendance reports of each and every department. For this, the administrator has to select particular dates and names of the department. The reports come with details such as attendance date, employee name, shift, check-in and out, notes, and in-out status. Here, the admin can simply generate a report and print it too. Besides, the admin can list out the highlights of the system such as total employees per shift, department’s employees, and more.
